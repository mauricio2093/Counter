# Counter

A new Flutter project.

## About the project

The application is based on a 1 in 1 click counter. It has 3 buttons -1, refresh and +1 and this counter has a limit that cannot be less than 0.

- Pressing the +1 button will generate a numerical sequence in which each number obtained will be the sum of 1 with the previous number, it has no limit.

- Pressing the -1 button will generate a numerical sequence in which each number obtained will be the subtraction of 1 with the previous number until it reaches 0, after this each time the button is pressed it will not obtain any change other than 0.

- When you press the refresh button, the value will change to 0 regardless of the number it is on.
